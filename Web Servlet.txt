 find it in downloads
 2. File -> Other locations -> Ubuntu/Computer -> opt folder
 3. If opt folder does not open, open with terminal, type """ sudo chmod 777 /opt """
 4. Now open opt folder, create a folder named """ tomcat """. Then go to terminal
 (if folder does not have write permission), and type """ sudo chmod 777 /opt/Tomcat """
 5. Go to downloads, click on tomcat zip file -> extract -> put the path as tomcat folder -> extract all
